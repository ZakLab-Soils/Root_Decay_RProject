Molecular Ecology, in review

##### **Overview**
1. Code for all analyses are contained in Roots_V4.Rmd and run in the Root_Decay_RProject.RProj. 

2. The 'data' directory contains all relevant content to run the code. All data is organized into subdirectories that corresponds to the code, with the exception of the Miseq data. The sequencing data can be downloaded from GeneBank under the BioProject [PRJNA714922](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA714922) and moved to the Manistee_Miseq_data directory in order to run the code as written.

3. The 'figures' directory contains completed figures as viewable PDFs.
